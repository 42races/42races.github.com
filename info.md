Hi, my name is Deepak, I live in Cochi(India) known as "queen of arabian sea" in "God's own country" Kerala.

I am working as a software developer with a startup [theamazingfactory] (http://theamazingfactory.com). I develop web applications using Ruby On Rails and ruby has became my favourite language.

Other than programing I read books and love to ride my Firefox Nitro bike. I am very much interested in pencil drawing and I do drawing occassionally.
