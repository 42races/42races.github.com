Hi, my name is Deepak, I live in Cochin(India) known as "queen of arabian sea" in "God's own country" Kerala.

I am working as a software developer. I develop web applications using Ruby On Rails and Ruby has became my favourite language.

Other than programing I read books and love to ride my Firefox Nitro bike.
