I have been thinking of a light and easy to cook breakfast dish for a while, today I made such a dish. I will share the experience here. I made a quick breakfast with omelet, french fries, toasted bread and black tea. The main highlight of the cooking experiment was making friench fries. French fries is made by frying elongated chopped pieces of potato. It can be served as a snack or a side dish.
