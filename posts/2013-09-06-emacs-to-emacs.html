<p>I have been using Emacs for more than 3 years. I started using it in my college days, one of our Lecturer introduced it to us. But during my college days I just used basic stuff and didn&#39;t explore much. I was more interested in IDEs like Netbeans, Qt Designer, Eclipse etc they are great IDEs. I didn&#39;t like Emacs much during those days. Later I used Vim which I felt was a lot more easier to use and a lot of people I know were using Vim, it was really hard to find someone using Emacs except a few of my friends and most of them gradually moved to other editors. There was a lot of articles and blogs about Vim which I felt very easy to understand, and I liked the idea of command mode and insert mode. I used to see a lot of video tutorials, also I have gone for many developer meetups and conferences. Everywhere I noticed people are more inclined towards Vim editor people took it as a honor to be a Vimer.</p>

<p>When I got my first job as a Ruby developer (2011-2012) developers at my company used Vim, Aptana Studio, Netbeans, Sublime Text and TextMate for development. I was a junior so my seniors told me about their editor of choice and many of them tried so hard to convince me the advantages of their favorite editor. I was confused and decided to experiment with different editors available. I used Geany, Redcar, Gedit with many plugins, Eclipse, Aptana Studio, Netbeans IDE, TextMate, Sublime Text etc.</p>

<p>Back in college I was mainly doing C, C++ coding, I was happy with Geany. I loved the interface and the syntax highlighting, there I needed to worry about only  *.c or *.cpp files. But at my company I was into Ruby On Rails team so I had to deal with a lot of formats rb, erb, html, js, css, yml, md, coffee etc etc. So I started looking for other editors. I got a Linux machine running Ubuntu at office, inspired from <a href="http://railscasts.com">RailsCasts</a> by Ryan Bates I wanted to use TextMate, I loved the editor, but TextMate was a paid editor and is only available for Mac. Then I found Redcar which was written in Ruby. It also provides a TextMate theme. The funniest thing was you can install Redcar using &quot;gem install redcar&quot;. But my experience was really disappointing, Redcar crashed many times, I felt it is very fragile and slow sometimes. I quit using it. Then I tried Gedit with some configuration change and some extra plugins which were available from the editor&#39;s plugin installer. I was happy using it the syntax highlighting was very pleasing, there was TextMate theme, side bar, light weight, auto completion I felt much more comfortable with Gedit but I wasn&#39;t happy, I didn&#39;t felt like I am coding. Gedit is great for plain text editing, with plugins you can make it better that&#39;s it and there wasn&#39;t many plugins available. Mainly I faced problems with syntax highlighting of erb files and navigation was a headache. I felt so dumb using a text editor for editing code.</p>

<p>At this point one of my senior convinced me about the advantages of using IDE, he recommended Aptana Studio. I tried it and found that it is actually Eclipse + some Rails plugins. I used it for few days and moved to Eclipse itself, then to Netbeans. IDE is great in the sense that It provides a lot of tools to format code, navigation, searching, syntax etc. they had version control integrated. But they will suck your computer resources. After using these IDEs for six or seven hours in a day it will be great pain in the ass even to type a single character. I had to quit my IDE many times and even restarted my system. But I loved Netbeans&#39; navigation to method definition on clicking the method name, I could even peep into to gem code easily.</p>

<p>During this period I was into a project in which I had to develop a cross platform mobile application plus the backend server. Backend I did in Rails and the mobile application I did in Rhomobile which is a cross platform mobile application framework, the framework produced native code which is then built using the native tools like Xcode, Android SDK, Windows Mobile 7 SDK and Blackberry SDK. I was too much excited about this project I was developing about five application at the same time, the application wasn&#39;t anything great, I had to create few API&#39;s which are basic CRUD operations, still I was exploring a lot of tools new frameworks. This time I got a Mac to work and I installed 30 day trial version of TextMate, the experience was nice I loved the snippets and the interface, after 30 days it got expired and I moved back to Eclipse. Another guy who just joined my company joined my project for a few days, I was excited to see that he was using Sublime Text which I have never seen before, I quickly moved to Sublime and I found it is super fast and had stunning interface, light as feather, mind blowing navigation, very easy to configure and it was free. I was pretty happy with Sublime Text 2, I thought I found my ultimate editor.</p>

<p>Then comes the days of editor wars couple of Vim guys in my office kept on kicking my ass for using Sublime. They said it was for kids and they used to show me a lot of Vim tricks, doing something in least number of key strokes. Deleting with dd, NERDTree, ack search, Command P. For whatever feature I showed them in Sublime they did the same with Vim plugins. They even made some sarcastic comments on features like minimap which even I didn&#39;t like (minimap I have disabled later). They convinced me that I can save hell lot of coding time if I didn&#39;t move my hands away form keyboard. More than that I used to see a lot of video tutorials from Peepcode and youtube, most of the geek developers I met were advocates of Vim.</p>

<p>Finally after all these brainwashing I moved to Vim for full time. As I said before since my last few months of college life I started using Vim but not regularly also I used vim for most of my coding at home hp mini netbook. I had fair amount of knowledge to use Vim without fumbling. But I wasn&#39;t aware much about the Vim plugins. These guys helped me a lot to setup Vim plugins, they suggested many plugins I tried most of them. I was getting better and better at Vim, people form other teams thought I was playing some game with keyboard, they used to ask me what tool am I using. Later I moved to MacVim which I felt much better and preconfigured than GVim. I started compelling others to move to Vim, I was totally into Vim gang it was really fun. Everything went so smooth tons of documentations, light weight, great navigation, great speed, totally loved command mode and insert mode, now I can work flawlessly in a terminal via ssh connection, I even tried some vimscript.</p>

<p>So life was going so smooth I began concentrating more on coding, Vim editor became my close friend. The only problem I faced is initial configuration of Vim when I changed systems. I found a solution by cloning other peoples vimfile repo which made my life easier again because they had lot of stuff which I had some hard time setting up.</p>

<p>When I moved to new company I noticed everyone was using Sublime Text there, I was the only Vim user. They didn&#39;t argue about editors so there wasn&#39;t any editor wars here, hence I got some free time to continue my experiment. For a change I used RubyMine which is awesome for Ruby On Rails development much like an advanced form of Netbeans IDE. RubyMine eliminates the inertia to hack into gem code because on single click you can view the gem code. I used Sublime when I used other systems there.</p>

<p>But I felt something was missing, I wanted more power, more generic. I started reading about editor wars, philosophy and concepts. I thought why I haven&#39;t even considered emacs for a long time. I started with Emacs, I didn&#39;t understand for what reason I quit using it. I thought of trying my hand on Emacs, but the experience was too bad. I was too much addicted to Vim, It was really hard to remember new key combinations. I just used the basic stuff learned from my college which are somehow embedded into my brain.</p>

<p>It was very hard to use Emacs without any configuration, even the starting screen sucks. I was disappointed, I felt like wasting my time. I lost track of keys, line numbers, fucked up with some questions asked by editor which I need to answer by typing yes or no otherwise it won&#39;t allow me to move on, hell lot of backup files. I wondered why some people says it is the ultimate editor, what the hell is wrong with people I thought. At this time I came to see a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yukihiro_matz/how-emacs-changed-my-life">presentation</a> by Ruby programming language creator Yukihiro Matsumoto (who is called <a href="https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz">Matz</a> in the Ruby community). He talked about how Emacs influenced him, also I have seen some great developers like <a href="https://twitter.com/jimweirich">Jim Weirich</a> using Emacs. Then next day onwards I started reading about Emacs in detail, I tried to figure out the following.</p>

<ul>
<li>How did Emacs influenced Matz to design Ruby?</li>
<li>Why there is not much documentation available on Emacs other that wiki and few blogs?</li>
<li>Why people says it is very powerful?</li>
</ul>

<p>I found some information from Emacs itself (documentation files) and others by reading many articles. I came to know the fact that Emacs is a lisp interpreter with a built in garbage collector, more than 90% of code is in lisp rest is C code. Emacs is much bigger than an editor it is a software machine, all it does is running lisp code,.</p>

<p>After learning Ruby for about two years I can sense a lot of similarities between Ruby and elisp. Then code loading in Ruby, block syntax, duck typing, garbage collector, printing error message style, exceptions, self documenting code etc are all influenced by Emacs. About the lack of documentation I was totally wrong. Emacs comes with complete documentation on itself. It is self documented you can directly go to the documentation on any elisp functions, any key strokes or elisp syntax. The problem is people are not patient enough to go through them. Those who does understands how simple it, most of them are geeks who knows how to solve their own problems and they have bigger problems to solve than re-documenting something already well documented. But still there can be difficulties in the initial phase to go through the documentation. I had faced many mostly regarding plugins, documentation about these plugins are also available online. I agree to the fact that if you are coming from some other editor Emacs learning curve can be steep but once you overcome this stage then you will feel the power of this editor, you don&#39;t feel like you are typing weird Control, Meta, x, c keys everything is meaningful. Emacs teaches us how software must be, how to write neat code, how to document code, how to give proper error messages.</p>

<p>Now I use emacs for almost all kind of editing. For notes, scratch notes, todo I use org mode, I use the shell inside emacs for most of command line jobs, magit for version control, projectile for handling my project. ack search, multitple cursors and etc etc and I am still exploring emacs.</p>
