I have been thinking of a light and easy to cook breakfast dish for a while, today I made such a dish. I will share the experience here. I made a quick breakfast with omelet, french fries, toasted bread and black tea. The main highlight of the cooking experiment was making friench fries. French fries is made by frying elongated chopped pieces of potato. It can be served as a snack or a side dish.

Here are the steps to cook french fries.

Step 1: Take a big sized potato and clean it.

Step 2: Cut the potato into elongated pieces.

Step 3: Pour oil(I used coconut oil) into the pan after heating the frying pan.

Step 4: Put some salt into the oil and stir it well.

Step 5: Put the chopped potatoes to into the boiling oil and cook until the color of the potatoes becomes brownish yellow.

Yeah, the french fries is ready to serve as a snack or as a side dish.
