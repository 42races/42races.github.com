Git is the only version control system I have used so far. I use git every day and I find it is really helping me to organize my code neatly. I find it is really easy to code without having any fear of conflicting with others code or my own code. It's really easy to work on multiple features at the same time by different people and then merge the features into a single codebase. Git maintains the history so I can even go back to a previous code point very easily. Here are few commands I use in daily life as well as in troubles.

# Basic commands

## Initialize a git repo

    $ git init

## Add a remote origin

    $ git remote add origin <git repo url>

## Add files to git

    $ git add filename

## Remove a file from git

    $ git rm filename

## Commit changes

    $ git commit -m "Commit message"

## Push to remote server

    $ git push origin branchname

## Pull from remote server

    $ git pull origin branchname

## View commit log

    $ git log

## View code changes

    $ git diff

## Restore a deleted file (deleted from file system not from git)

    $ git checkout filename

## Revert a changed file back to original file

    $ git reset --hard HEAD filename

## Revert a changed file back to original file without loosing changes

    $ git reset --soft HEAD filename

## Reverting back to version before last commit

    $ git reset --hard HEAD^ filename

## Reverting back to version before last commit without loosing changes

    $ git reset --soft HEAD^ filename

## Edit your last commit message after the commit

    $ git commit --amend

## Remove the cached file from git

    $ git rm  --cached filename
    $ git rm -r --cached .   # will remove all the git cached files from git.

By default git won't ignore the files which are already added to git and later added to .gitignore
so to ignore them later remove them form cache.

# Branching

## Create a new branch

    $ git branch -b test_branch

## Checkout a remote branch from origin

    $ git checkout -b sprint-15 origin/sprint-15

## List all the available branches

    $ git branch

## Switch to the new branch

    $ git checkout test_branch

## Merging two branches

    $ git merge test_branch   # test_branch will get merged with current branch

## Delete a branch

    $ git branch -d test_branch # This command ensures that the changes in the test_branch are already in current branch

## Rename a branch

    $ git branch -m old_branch new_branch

# Other commands

## Git gui tools

    $ gitk

or

    $ git gui

## UNDO - merge

    $ git reset --hard HEAD      # before committing
    $ git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD # after  committing

## Bash Prompt with git branch info

    function git_branch_name(){
        git_head=$(git symbolic-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null) || return
        echo "["${git_head#refs/heads/}"]"
    }

    export PS1="\u@\W \$(git_branch_name)\$ \n ->"

## Colorful display of git (status, diff, branch) etc

    git config --global color.status  true

## Configure core editor for git

    git config --global core.editor emacs

## Git log with commit info

    git log -p

## Advanced git config -edit the configuration file

    git config --global -e      # this will open the config file

    [alias]
      lg = log --color --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit --no-merges
      st = status
      ci = commit
      br = branch
      co = checkout
      df = diff
      show-files = show --pretty="format:" --name-only

# Issues I have faced.

## Could not execute editor

    /usr/libexec/git-core/git-sh-setup: line 106: /usr/bin/mate: No such file or directory
    Could not execute editor

    git config --global core.editor vim  this didn't work for me

fix

    set GIT_EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim
    export $GIT_EDITOR

## Reset file permissions in git and restore the file status

    $ git diff -p \
      | grep -E '^(diff|old mode|new mode)' \
      | sed -e 's/^old/NEW/;s/^new/old/;s/^NEW/new/' \
      | git apply
