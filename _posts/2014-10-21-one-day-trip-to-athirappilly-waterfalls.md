Today after the breakfast I was going through SLANG compiler code by Praseed Pai. Suddenly the thought has came to me after joining my new startup (3dify Protosolutions) I haven't gone for a trip, its been more than six months. So I just asked my friend Sreenath who was doing 3d product design in the next room about going out for a trip. He was very interested and suddenly we packed our bags, he got a camera and I got a bike (Bajaj Pulsar 180). We desided to go to Athirappilly waterfalls. I have never visited that place before even though it only around 70Km from my hometown.

We started by 10.30 AM from Aluva rode though NH47 till Chalakkudy, the climate was very friendly not so sunny, bit cloudy day. We thought about having the chances of rain but we didn't mind much, luckily rain didn't caught us. Athirappilly is situated in Trissur district in Kerala, near a place called Chalakkudy. The fall is at 120m hight from sea level and is about 100m wide and is in Chalakkudy river which is originated from Aanamudy. The road was in pretty good shape so riding was smooth.

Athirappilly is about 31Km away from Chalakkudy town. On the way you will notice large plantations of palm tree which is about 3-4 kilometers long spread along right side the road. On the left side there are many homes, rubber plantations, teak, buffalo breeding farm and many other things. Dream World and Silverstorm water theme parks are on the same way. There are many lodging and hotel facilities in that area.

By 12.15 we reached Tumburmuzhi dam. Tumburmuzhi is a small dam and a very beautiful garden with so much butterflies. The turbulent Chalakkudy river flows through this place. If you are lucky with low water level you can walk through the shallow parts of the river or through the dam itself and cross to the other side of the river which is called Ezahattumugham Prakrithi Gramam but we weren't so lucky. We took a few photos and had a nice meal(50 Rs) from a nearby restaurant. We left the place by 1:40 PM and reached Athirappilly (16Km from Thumburmuzhi) by 2.15 PM.

Athirappilly is a very beautiful and clean place. From the ticket counter we started walking through stone paved road toward the waterfall. The river was flowing very fast and was turbulent. There were so many monkeys at that place mocking at people posing for photos drinking water from the still rocky river side. We took few photos from there and went down to see the waterfall from the bottom which is about 25m below. You have to walk very carefully through the stone paved road. It was really exciting place, I felt like the place is always raining. We had a hard time taking photos of the waterfall from that place. The water hitting the stones scattered into fine drops and wets the surroundings. The whole river looked very dangerous, with its cunning beauty and smooth curves it called me to dive in, since there are so many accidental deaths guards won't allow you to dive in. We took a few photos   and climb back to the top it was really hard, I was exhausted. We took a cup of hot tea and relaxed for some time. It started to rain slightly. We left Athirappilly by 3.30 PM, the return journey was bit hard because the road was fully wet and traffic was getting denser, we reached back at Aluva by 5:15 PM.
